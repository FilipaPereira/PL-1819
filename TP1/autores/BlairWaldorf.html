<h1 align="center"> Blair Waldorf </h1>
<hr><p><b>-</b> If you wanna be part of this world, Jenny, people will talk, eventually. You need to decide if all this is worth it.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> Haven't you heard? I'm the crazy bitch around here&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> Serena likes to see the best of people, I like to see the truth&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> It’s no use to deny the past. Chuck is a part of me. He’ll always be.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> I said civilized, not lobotomized.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> Why don't you just sky write the word &quot;Double Cross&quot;. It'll be more subtle.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> Blair: I could never like you either. In fact, I hate you.&quot;</p>
