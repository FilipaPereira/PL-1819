<h1 align="center"> Little Richard </h1>
<hr><p><b>-</b> Eu vim de uma família onde o meu povo não gostava de ritmo e blues. [[Bing Crosby]] - &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; [tostões do Céu] - [[Ella Fitzgerald]], era tudo que eu ouvi&quot;.</p>
<p><b>-</b> Quando eu ouvi '''Little Richard''' eu comprei um saxofone e entrei no negócio da música. Little Richard foi minha inspiração.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> Eu queria fazer com a minha guitarra o que Little Richard consegue fazer com sua voz.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> I wanna introduce a man that started a kind of music that set the pace for a lot of what's happening today. Ladies and gentlemen, if you don't mind, here is my man, bless his little sweet heart, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Little Richard!&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> Little Richard was a one-of-a-kind show business genius. He influenced so many people in the business.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> Little Richard is my idol.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> Your music has inspired me - you are the greatest.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> Little Richard is the beginning of Rock 'n' Roll.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> Richard is an original, and the songs he's written and the songs he's done and made famous are just one of a kind.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> Little Richard represented what I wanted to be. He was, and still is, my idol.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> Richard opened the door. He brought the races together. When I first went on the road their were many segragated audiences. With Richard, although they still had the audiences segragated in the building, they were there TOGETHER. And most times before the end of the night, they would all be mixed together. Up until then, the audiences were either all black or all white and no one else could come in. His records weren't boy-meets-girl-girl-meets-boy things, they were FUN records, all fun. And they had a lot to say sociologically in our country and the world. The shot was fired here and heard around the world.&quot;  &quot;When Richard opened his mouth, man, everyone could enjoy it. He's got a voice that would make 'em jump up and down... that's the first time I ever saw spotlights and flicker lights used at a concert show. It had all been used in show business but he brought it into our world.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> I love Little Richard. He is a great entertainer and he has done so much for our music.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> If it hadn't been for Little Richard, I would not be here. I entered the music business because of Richard - he is my inspiration. I used to sing like Little Richard, his Rock 'n' Roll stuff, you know. Richard has soul, too. My present music has a lot of him in it.&quot; </p>
<p><b>-</b> I want to do with my guitar what Little Richard does with his voice.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> Little Richard is the Architect of Rock and Roll.”</p>
<p><b>-</b> He is the King of Rock 'n' Roll.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> Little Richard was not only a giant but a pioneer of the so-called Rock 'n' Roll music industry. He had such a unique voice and style that no one else has matched it... Rock 'n' Soul is here to stay!&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> I never thought I'd ever meet Little Richard. He was my idol at school. The first song I ever sang in public was 'Long Tall Sally,' at a Butlins holiday camp talent competition! I love his voice and I always wanted to sing like him.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> Thank you all very much, especially the rock 'n' rollers, an' Little Richard there (pointing to him) - it was all his fault really.&quot; - 1988 (At the Beatles induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.)</p>
<p><b>-</b> Elvis was bigger than religion in my life. Then this boy at school said he'd got this record by somebody called Little Richard who was better than Elvis. We used to go to this boys house after school and listen to Elvis on 78s: we'd buy five ciggies loose and some chips and go along. The new record was Little Richard's 'Long Tall Sally'. When I heard it, it was so great I couldn't speak. You know how you are torn. I didn't want to leave Elvis but this was so much better. We all looked at each other. I didn't want to say anything against Elvis, even in my mind. How could they both be happening in my life? And then someone siad, &quot;It's a nigger singing.&quot; I didn't know negroes sang. So Elvis was white and Little Richard was black. This was a great relief. &quot;Thank you God,&quot; I said. &quot;There is a difference between them.&quot; But I though about it for days at school, of the labels on the records of Elvis and Little Richard. One was yellow and the other was blue, and I thought of the yellow against the blue.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> I had heard so much about the audience reaction that I thought there must be some exaggeration. But it was all true. He drove the whole house into a complete frenzy. There's no single phrase to describe his hold on the audience. I couldn't believe the power of Little Richard on stage. He was amazing. Chuck Berry is my favorite, along with Bo (Diddley), but nobody could beat Little Richard's stage act. Little Richard is the originator and my first idol.&quot;  </p>
<p><b>-</b> Little Richard is King.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> The most exciting moment of my life was appearing on the same stage as Little Richard.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> Once you have seen this man you know instantly that you have seen the greatest Rock n Roll legend of our time.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> I was a little kid when I heard Little Richard. He was playing piano and singing that song,&quot; recalls Green before breaking into the opening lines of Richard's &quot;Jenny, Jenny.&quot; Even then, he continues, &quot;I knew he was a classic, one-of-a-kind. I never heard (anyone) with that kind of enthusiasm.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> Little Richard, man, was the god! I grew up on Little Richard in the rocking 50's.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> Well I'd certainly have to have a tip of the hat to Little Richard. I'd say it's sort of a composite guy, because obviously I love Wilson Pickett, and there are a few guys who have that sort of high, edgy thing, Little Richard being the best and the most famous. Wilson even screamed in tune. My voice came out a certain way and I've learned to be that way.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> Little Richard - he was the first one that really got to me. Little Richard and, of course, Elvis Presley.&quot;  &quot;I don't know if it was because of James Brown and Little Richard, I always preferred a high energy vocal, a hard full-force vocal. I liked Little Richard better than Elvis, and I liked James Brown better than the Beatles...but the Miracles were a heavy influence on me, too...[though] I always preferred the more energized vocals.&quot; (Late-1981 radio interview from segerfile.com)</p>
<p><b>-</b> The first Rock 'n' Roll record I listened to was 'The Girl Can't Help It,' by Little Richard.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> The first 45 I ever played was by Little Richard. Even today, I constantly listen to Little Richard.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> There would have been no DEEP PURPLE if there had been no Little Richard.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> When I was in high school I wanted to be like Little Richard.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> Little Richard's records were the best Rock 'n' Roll records.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> After hearing Little Richard on record, I bought a saxaphone and came into the music business. Little Richard was my inspiration.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> James Brown, Ray Charles, Jackie Wilson, Chuck Berry and Little Richard - I think they had strong influences on a lot of people, because these were the guys who really got rock'n'roll going. I like to start with the origin of things, because once it gets along it changes. It's so interesting to see how it really was in the beginning.&quot; - 1983</p>
<p><b>-</b> The man who started rock n roll.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> In the spiritual poll of Rock n Roll, Little Richard is a tried and true original. Since his beginning, all have picked up from his style and from his music, from the early Beatles to Mick Jagger today. At one time it was all Little Richard's original raving craving thing.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> Little Richard is a great originator. He was right there at the start, a thrilling performer.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> Little Richard is twice as valid artistically and important historically as Elvis Presley, the Beatles, and the Rolling Stones put together.&quot;</p>
<p><b>-</b> No on person has been imitated more than Little Richard.&quot;</p>
